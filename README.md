### Inflation Tail Risk
[Publication]()

The study demonstrates that future inflation risk is priced into stock returns and credit spreads. This holds true even when controlling for current and historical inflation moments. The analysis employs inflation caps and floors to obtain the
distribution of future inflation under the risk-neutral measure. Credit spreads decrease as the mean and median of future inflation rise, but they respond positively to tail risks. Conversely, stocks serve as a robust hedge against future inflation. Stock returns increase with a higher mean and median of future inflation and rising inflationary tail risk, while they decrease with rising deflationary tail risk. **Quantitative Methods**: SABR Model, Optimization Algorithms, Gradient Descent, Regressions, **Programming Language**: Python

### Mind the Inflation Swap
[Publication]()

This paper identifies a convexity bias in using inflation swap rates to estimate market inflation expectations. We propose a correction method using inflation caps and floors for more accurate estimates. Our analysis reveals that this bias is particularly pronounced during periods of high inflation uncertainty, when accurate measurements of inflation expectations are most crucial. We demonstrate that this bias has historically led to significant economic impacts on the measure of long-term inflation expectations. It has also introduced measurement errors in related variables, such as real interest rates and the inflation risk premium, leading to inconsistencies in the signs of these measures. **Quantitative Methods**: Taylor Expansion, SABR Model, Optimization Algorithms, Gradient Descent, Regressions, **Programming Language**: Python

### PCA on Inflation Swaps
[Publication](https://medium.com/@bastiluber12/pca-on-inflation-swaps-69077159ec0e)

This study applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the zero-coupon inflation swap curve, identifying three key components—level, slope, and curvature—that account for over 99% of its variation from 2009 to 2023. Building on these insights, a new duration measure is introduced, enabling independent hedging of each component. The study also demonstrates how to construct a portfolio that remains neutral to changes in all three principal components.
